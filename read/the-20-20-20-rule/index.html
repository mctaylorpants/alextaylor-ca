          <p>The 20/20/20 rule has changed how I work, for the better – and not just for my eyes!</p>

<p>A few months ago, I started noticing my eyes becoming increasingly dry and tired after a long day staring at my computer screen. It’s so easy to forget to take breaks when you’re in the zone, and I realized I was becoming increasingly guilty of this.</p>

<p>When I started thinking about how I could build more regular breaks into my routine, I remembered something my optometrist told me about: <a href="https://opto.ca/eye-health-library/20-20-20-rule"><strong>the 20/20/20 rule</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="minutes-20-seconds-20-feet">
<a href="#minutes-20-seconds-20-feet"></a>20 minutes, 20 seconds, 20 feet</h2>

<p>Here’s how the 20/20/20 rule works:</p>

<p><strong>Every 20 minutes</strong>, give your eyes a break by focusing on something <strong>20 feet away</strong> for at least <strong>20 seconds</strong>. This helps relax your eyes and goes a long way to prevent eye-strain from screen use.</p>

<p>(The sole disadvantage of the metric system is that 20/20/6.096 just doesn’t have the same ring to it. But I digress!)</p>

<p>There are lots of apps that help automate this habit: I ended up settling on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intermission-breaks-for-eyes/id1439431081?mt=12">Intermission</a> for macOS, which is simple and flexible.</p>

<h2 id="the-20-second-check-in">
<a href="#the-20-second-check-in"></a>The 20-second check-in</h2>

<p>Following this rule has definitely helped with my eye strain – I’ve even got my coworkers in on it when the reminder pops up during a screen share!</p>

<p>But it’s not just my eyes that have benefited from this. I’ve started using the breaks in a few different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Avoid rabbit-holing</strong>. If I’ve been stuck on something, I’ll ask myself during the break: what’s the real problem I’m trying to solve? Have I made any progress, or should I change my approach / ask someone for help?</li>
  <li>
<strong>Take a step back</strong>. How am I feeling? Am I stressed? Am I in the zone?</li>
  <li>
<strong>Move around.</strong> I’ll shake out my wrists or do some neck stretches while I stare off into the distance, and I might use the opportunity to switch from sitting to standing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="give-it-a-shot">
<a href="#give-it-a-shot"></a>Give it a shot!</h2>

<p>I’ve really started to enjoy the cadence of these quick micro-breaks. One of the downsides is that it makes you extremely aware of the passage of time – especially if you use an app that never ceases to remind you. But overall, I’ve found it works well for me. My eyes certainly thank me for it!</p>

<p>If you also find yourself in need of more breaks, I’d encourage you to give the 20/20/20 rule a try!</p>
