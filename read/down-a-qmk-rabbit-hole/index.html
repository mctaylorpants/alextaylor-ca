          <p>Today I went down a fun rabbit hole of <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>, the open-source firmware for mechanical keyboards (and other input devices). Like the start of any good rabbit hole, it all started with an extremely specific mission: fixing a minor nit with my new keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="tapping-too-fast">
<a href="#tapping-too-fast"></a>TAPPING too fast</h2>
<p>I bought a <a href="https://nuphy.com/collections/keyboards/products/air75-v2">NuPhy Air75 V2</a> to try out a low-profile mechanical keyboard (it’s also nice that it’s wireless!).</p>

<p>I started using <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">VIA Configurator</a> to remap keys. In particular, I wanted to try a home-row arrow setup which would let me use the vim-style mapping of h, j, k, and l as ←, ↑, ↓, and →. Since I still obviously want to use those keys for their intended alphabetical purpose, a modifier key was in order. Hey, Caps Lock is on the home row too, and I already remap it to Esc… why not modify it even further so that holding down Caps Lock triggers another layer?</p>

<p>After a few trips to Google and Claude, I got the mapping code I wanted:</p>

<p><code>
LT(7, KC_ESC)
</code></p>

<p>I used the <code>LT</code> (“layer tap”) function to activate layer 7 when held, or Esc when tapped. From there, it was a simple matter to remap h, j, k and l to the arrow keys on layer 7. Perfect!</p>

<p>… and then I tried using it.</p>

<p>As it turns out, when I use arrow keys, I use them quickly. I’m often tapping up on the command-line or in the address bar to navigate history. Using the layer-tap, I found it wasn’t responding quickly enough and I’d end up sending “k” instead of “up” unless I held down Caps Lock for a (admittedly minuscule, but nevertheless infuriating) moment.</p>

<p>More trips to the search gods led me to a tantalizing solution: a config setting named “<a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/tap_hold#hold-on-other-key-press">Hold On Other Key Press</a>”. From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This mode makes tap and hold keys (like Layer Tap) work better for fast typists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It me! Problem solved. Except, this option is <em>not</em> configurable through VIA Configurator: it’s a lower-level configuration that needs to be set in the firmware itself.</p>

<p>Enter my QMK rabbit hole.</p>

<h2 id="down-we-go">
<a href="#down-we-go"></a>Down we go…</h2>

<p>As far as rabbit holes go, this ended up being a shallow one. QMK’s toolchain is really nice, and pleasant to work with. I ran through <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_getting_started">the tutorial</a> and found my way to Reddit when I realized that NuPhy’s QMK support is not particularly straightforward.</p>

<p>Here’s what I ended up doing:</p>

<p><strong>Set up QMK with NuPhy’s custom branch.</strong> I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NuPhy/comments/1dsve0c/compiling_qmk_for_nuphy_keyboards_spoiler_alert/">a helpful Reddit post</a> on how to do this, since NuPhy’s keyboards haven’t made their way into the main QMK repo yet - they’ve got their own fork.</p>

<p><code>
qmk setup nuphy-src/qmk_firmware -b nuphy-keyboards
</code></p>

<p>Mercifully, I had none of the compile issues mentioned in the thread!</p>

<p><strong>Take the compiler for a spin.</strong> As suggested in the Reddit post, I tried compiling the keymap built for VIA Configurator:</p>

<p><code>
qmk compile -kb nuphy/air75_v2/ansi -km via
</code></p>

<p>This generated a <code>.bin</code> file, which I could use to…</p>

<p><strong>Flash the firmware.</strong> I used <a href="https://qmk.fm/toolbox">QMK Toolbox</a> to load the <code>.bin</code> file and flash the firmware on to my keyboard (which involved holding down Esc when you plug it in to boot the keyboard into flashing mode).</p>

<h2 id="new-firmware-who-dis">
<a href="#new-firmware-who-dis"></a>New firmware, who dis?</h2>

<p>After poking around with various configuration files, I got myself oriented:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code>keyboards/nuphy/air75_v2/ansi</code> is the root folder of the firmware I’m working with; it’s full of C files that configure the keyboard itself, and what ends up compiling down to the <code>.bin</code> file.</li>
  <li>Within this folder, <code>config.h</code> contains a bunch of - unsurprisingly - config directives. Here I added one line: <strong><code>#define HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS</code></strong>, which is the whole reason I went on this journey in the first place!</li>
  <li>There’s a <code>keymaps</code> folder where you can store various mappings of the keys themselves. I suppose this is more “user-facing” so it’s kept separate from the lower-level config of the keyboard. I know you can define your own custom keymap, but I didn’t touch anything in here because I want to keep using VIA Configurator while I’m playing around layout.</li>
  <li>Finally, I have a <code>json</code> file I exported from VIA Configurator’s web UI after I set up my key mappings. This is <em>not</em> the same format as QMK’s JSON format (<a href="https://github.com/nuphy-src/qmk_firmware/blob/nuphy-keyboards/keyboards/nuphy/air75_v2/ansi/keymaps/via/NuPhy%20Air75%20V2%20via3.json">like this one provided by NuPhy for use in VIA</a>), which was confusing to me at first. For VIA, I think the QMK JSON file is used to load in the keyboard definition, and the exportable JSON file is just used for saving the updated key mapping.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually once I’m reasonably happy with the layout, I could conceivably compile it directly into the default keymap. But for now, this toolchain works nicely!</p>

<p>And the best part: now my arrow-taps are lightning fast! ⚡️</p>
