_Since I started_ learning and working with Rails, I've always had a goal to contribute. Whether it's a feature, a bugfix or even a typo fix, contributing to Rails is a great way of giving back to the community. And on a personal note, I've always looked at it as a bit of a barometer to measure my understanding of the framework.

I recently came across something in Rails I wanted to fix, so I [put up a PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/43570) and it was accepted. Now I'm on the [contributors list](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/alex-taylor/commits)! ðŸŽ‰

The PR is tiny, but it's an important milestone for me: I had enough knowledge and context to know where to look when our team encountered some funny behaviour around load paths, and I saw an opportunity for removing some [surprising behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).

Here's to more contributions in the future!
